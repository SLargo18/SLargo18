## 🚀 About Me
Welcome to my GitHub! I’m Santiago, a developer obsessed with digging into the guts of low-level programming and conquering system-level challenges. Born in Colombia, now creating and evolving in Spain, my code is a reflection of persistence, precision, and passion.

Here, every project is a battlefield where I sharpen my skills in C, algorithms, and memory management. I don't just write code—I fight for elegant, efficient solutions that stand the test of time.</p>

## ✅ Projects I've Completed</p>  

| Project          | Description                                                                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Push_swap**    | Crafting optimized algorithms to sort stacks with minimal moves — where every operation counts.  |
| **Get_next_line** | Mastering dynamic memory by efficiently reading file descriptors line by line.                   |
| **ft_printf**    | Rebuilding the classic printf from scratch — handling all those tricky format specifiers and flags. |
| **Pipex**        | Simulating shell pipes and command executions with true inter-process communication magic.       |
| **FdF**          | Bringing wireframe 3D models to life with projections and Bresenham’s line algorithm.             |

Each project pushed my limits and honed my ability to debug, optimize, and understand systems at their core.
